# Quiznos App Redesign

## Overview

This is a redesigned version of the Quiznos app, built using Next.js. The redesign focuses on improving user experience, clarity, and navigation.

## Improvements

Renamed "Promotions" to "Deals & Offers": This change makes it clear that the section includes coupons and discounts.

Updated "More" to "Account" or "Settings & Profile": This improves clarity and prevents confusion for users looking for profile-related settings.

Consistent Back Button Placement: Ensures smooth and predictable navigation throughout the app.

Relocated "Need Help" to Profile Section: Instead of removing it entirely, moving it to the profile section makes it easily accessible.

Enhanced "Scan QR Code" Button Visibility: Making this button more prominent ensures users can quickly find and use it.
